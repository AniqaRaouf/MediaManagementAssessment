# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Clone this Project

First, you will need clone this repo using github desktop or anything you like.

## Step 2: Install Node modules and Pods

To install node modules please run the following command into the root directory of your cloned project.


```bash
npm Install
```
After this run this 

```bash
cd ios

```

```bash
pod install
```
## Step 3: Start the metro bundler, by running following command into the root directory of your project.

```bash
npm start
```

## Step 4: Start Apps on emulator and simulator.

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```
or Other way is run the app using android studio and then click reload to connect to the metro bundler.



### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```
or Other way is run the app using xcode and that will automatically connect to the metro bundler.


You can also start apps on your phones, after connecting them with a wire , shake and set the ip to connect the bundler.
Follow this link to setup on physical device .https://reactnative.dev/docs/running-on-device


If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.



## Congratulations! :tada:
